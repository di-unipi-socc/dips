%%%%% Example 2 %%%%%
% The intent requires that storageVF run on a dedicated server AND
% that encodeVF *possibly* runs on the same server as storageVF. Conflict.
% Solution: ignore nodeAffinity as it is soft (shadowing). Inform user?

%%%%% Example 3 %%%%%
% The intent requires that storageVF run on a dedicated server AND
% that encodeVF *possibly* runs on the same server as storageVF. Conflict.
% Solution: ignore nodeAffinity as it is soft (shadowing). Inform user?


%%%%% Example 3 %%%%%
% The intent requires that end-to-end bandwidth is at least 50Mbps AND
% that bandwidth between encodeVF and decodeVF is at most 10Mbps. Conflict.
% Solution: inform user? or just fail?

%%%%% Example 4 %%%%%
% The intent requires possibly that end-to-end bandwidth is at least 50Mbps AND
% that possibly bandwidth between encodeVF and decodeVF is at most 10Mbps. Conflict.
% Solution: ignore both as they are soft. Inform user?

%%%%% Example 5 %%%%%
% The intent requires an edge caching service between storageVF and encodeVF AND
% that the overall hardware consumption of the chain is at most 25GB.
% Caching requires 30GB alone. Conflict.
% Solution: inform user? or just fail?

%%%%% Example 6 %%%%%
% In base al contratto stipulato dall'AppOp, il tetto di 25 GB (esempio precedente) viene fissato dall' InfrPr,
% quindi Ã¨ un suo intento.
