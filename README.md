*DIPS* is a Prolog tool that exploits a declarative methodology for modelling and processing VNF-based service provisioning intents. 
DIPS enables users (i.e. application providers) to specify their desired VNF chain requirements in a high-level language that captures their intent, such as the type of service to be provided, possible location constraints (e.g. at the _edge_), Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g. _latency_ and _bandwidth_), but also non-functional requirements (e.g. _privacy_ and _logging_). DIPS leverages Prolog inference to translate intents into provisioning specifications.

1. Download or clone this repository. Make sure you have [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) installed.

2. In the project folder, run the following command on the command line, to access the SWI-Prolog console and load the main file:
    ```console 
    swipl dips.pl
    ```

3. Execute the main query:
    ```prolog
    :- dips(IntentId, Output).
    ```

    where `IntentId` is the unique ID of the intent to be processed, and `Output` is the output of the reasoner.
    Be sure to set the correct NumberOfUsers that the intent will serve in the `intent/4`fact, located in the `data/services/<service_name>.pl` file.

    `Output` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(L, Placement, UP)`:
    - `L` is the number of unsatisfied properties (i.e. the number of properties that do not meet expectations) 
    - `Placement` is the placement of the VNF chain, and
    - `UP` is the list of unsatisfied properties.

    `UP` is also a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(Property, Desired, Actual)`: 
    - `Property` that is not satisfied, 
    - `Desired` is the desired value for that property, and
    - `Actual` is the actual value obtained by the respective placement.

## Output Example &nbsp;<picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3488/3488340.png"><img width="20" height="20" alt="files" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3488/3488804.png"></picture>

```prolog
Output = [(0, [on(encVF, s, gateway), on(edgeGamingVF, l, edge1), on(encVF, s, edge1), on(logVF, s, cloud1), on(cloudGamingVF, m, cloud1)], []), 
 	  (0, [on(encVF, s, gateway), on(edgeGamingVF, l, edge1), on(encVF, s, edge1), on(logVF, s, cloud1), on(cloudGamingVF, m, cloud2)], []), 
	  â€¦
	  (1, [on(encVF, s, gateway), on(edgeGamingVF, l, edge2), on(encVF, s, gateway), on(logVF, s, cloud2), on(cloudGamingVF, m, cloud1)], 
          [(bandwidth, desired(100), actual(30))]), 
	  (1, [on(encVF, s, gateway), on(edgeGamingVF, l, edge2), on(encVF, s, gateway), on(logVF, s, cloud2), on(cloudGamingVF, m, cloud2)], 
          [(bandwidth, desired(100), actual(30))])].
```
